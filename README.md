# Grandia Remastered Redux

This is a repository for the port of Grandia Redux into the 2019 Released Grandia HD Remaster

# Installing from Release
If you only care about playing the game in the Redux version you can just download the latest release extract the files over folder of the Games download path. 
Make sure that you backup your save files first as I take no responsibility in you loosing your game files.
Your saves on Windows are Located in: ```%APPDATA%/GRANDIA1```

# Requirements for Recreation:
- The Steam version of the HD Remaster
- ISO Rips from the Original North American Playstation 1 Release of the Game
- PPF Patch files from Grandia Redux

This entire process is pretty unstable at this stage and I would not suggest anyone to recreate it. But in case anyone wants to reinact this (and so I dont forget 2 years down the line).

Also just as a disclaimer I mainly used Windows for this so all the Software Im suggesting is tailored towards my workflow there are surely fitting Linux alternatives for all this. If you want to suggest software alternatives for me to include them into here just write me a message.

## Preparation
Patch the original games two Iso files using a software like [ppf-o-matic](http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/356/) together with the .ppf files. Im including these two rar Archives with this repository since the original downloads dont seem to exist anymore.

Mount the patched Iso Files with software like [Virtual Clone Drive](https://www.elby.ch/en/products/vcd.html)

Extract the files from the disks into seperate Folders like this:
```
+---ReduxGameFiles
|   +---DISK1
|   |   +---BATLE
|   |   +---BIN
|   |   \---FIELD
|   \---DISK2
|       +---BATLE
|       +---BIN
|       \---FIELD
```
Just copy over the Folders doing what we are about to do does not need the files inside the root directory


## The easy parts

Since the HD version is just a glorified PS1 Game you can copy some files straight over into the content Folder of the Remaster

## Using the Code


## Fixing up the Result
