# Grandia Remastered Redux

This is a repository for the port of Grandia Redux into the 2019 Released Grandia HD Remaster

# Important Note:
While being designed to be as close to the Grandia ReDux romhack made by Dunal back in 2011, there are a few differences that did get lost in conversion. This Port is working off of the 3.1/3.0 Version of ReDux

Before trying to install this make sure that you backup your save files first as I take no responsibility in you losing your progress.
Your saves on Windows are Located in: ```%APPDATA%/GRANDIA1```


# Installing from Release:
To install this patch download the latest release package and extract the contents folder into the games install directory. Windows should prompt you to replace 225 Files. Confirming this prompt will install the patch.

After installing start up a new playthrough and ensure that Redux was installed properly by Reading the Hint message found at the savepoint in the Port of Parm it should provide you with some information on Grandia ReDux.

Have fun!

# Differences/Known Issues:
- The Price of the Lump of Coal item is now fixed to the old Disk 1 value of 250G. This price will no longer increase in later stages of the game. 
This is caused by the remaster merging files that were seperated onto two Disks in the original game. It will likely not get fixed.

- The MP costs displayed in the magic screen outside of combat might not be accurate. Most notably Diggin is listed as costing 15MP while only costing 5MP until the end of what used to be Disk 1 in the original game. 
Since this is only visual and does not have an easy solution it likely wont get fixed.

- The Thief Cutter does not work properly. This problem is outlined in Issue #13 and hopefully will get fixed eventually

- Issues that were present in the original ReDux 3.1 romhack have not been fixed. The Ice Pick for example still has no strength stat.
