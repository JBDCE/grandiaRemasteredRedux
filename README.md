# Grandia Upscaler

This is a repository for work on a software that can upscale the assets from the 2019 Remaster from the 1998 game Grandia

## Todo

+ Collecting the assets
+ Splitting the atlas files into lots of single files
+ Checking for duplicates
+ Downscaling the single asset back into the small picture format
+ Stitching together the files to form them back into the needed structure
