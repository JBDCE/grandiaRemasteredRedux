when copying all files from battle in fight stats are set properly
for some reason the enemy stats are all saved collectively inside of m_dat.bin and player stats are mirrored over more than 100 files for each battle individually.. What the actual fuck

Item Descriptions hidden inside battle/bxxx.bbgh files - Take the last file from the final boss fight so it contains all items

Character Starting mp inside bin/mchar.dat - Can be straight copied from the redux disk (Needs checking if d1 or d2)

field/Windt.bin Modded Item Effects - Notably price in shops Seems to need proper merge between disks
 Also a straight copy
field/Shop.bin Shop contents - Straigt copy
field.mdp files need to be copied else the shop items dont appear


battle/M_DAT.bin Enemy HP EXP Drops NOT ALL - Needs a proper merge with generateM_DAT.py

Modded Attack names need to be replaced inside of TEXT/EN/strings.txt - output strings should be generated together with the M_DAT file

mchar.dat contains the information about spells learned by the characters but not the listing from the "moves" tab


WINDT.BIN Item Stat analysis:

For example the hex for the Lump of coal
Length 28 Bytes

40 00 76 88 50 C3 3E 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0A 24 0B 00 08 00 02 00 02 00 00 00

Some things are double bytes and they are apparently read flipped someway? 40 00 is the Item id and the number is meant to be read as 00 40 these are hex numbers and after converting to decimal this becomes 64 which lines up with the item id in the debug menue

Here is the things i know
Offset		HexVal		Use from the Debug menue
0			[00 40] 	Item ID
2			[88 76]		USE_STATUS (No idea)
4			[C3 50]		COST
5			[3E]		ICON-NO
6 - 14		[80]		(No idea)
15			[0A]		Para-1 before slash (No idea)
16			[24]		Para-2
17			[0B]		Para-3
18			[00]		Para-4

19			[00 08]		Para-1 after the slash
21			[00 02]		Para-2
23			[00 02]		Para-3
25			[00 00]		Para-4


In the appdata directory there is a file beeing created everytime the game is run called console.txt it contains log output from the game
the main menue is fully loaded after the line 
loaded texture 'content/bin/codefonts_codefonts__atlas.png'
possibly usefull to identify the location of character skills

For Loading are 5800
Possible files are
5800.mdp (Unlikely as its already pulled from redux)
s58__.vab
fc09.dat
field.bin
gm1_en.idx
pgr05.cpr (Most likely canidate as it contains party group information)

ISSUES:

- Mad Snail Spin attack crashing the game
    Maybe id mismatch between original and remaster needs fix inside mdat.bin


- Rap gets alheal in his lv 2 magic may be issue in mchar.dat but not sure
   Is only an issue if rapp fights in battles not meant for him. Playing through the normal game this does not happen.
- Lump of coal needs its price adapted otherwise its impossible to buy in the beginning of the game. Fixing it to 250g in release 0.4.8
