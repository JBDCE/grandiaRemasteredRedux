Item Descriptions hidden inside battle/bxxx.bbgh files - Take the last file from the final boss fight so it contains all items

Character Starting mp inside bin/mchar.dat - Can be straight copied from the redux disk (Needs checking if d1 or d2)

field/Windt.bin Modded Item Effects - Also a straight copy

battle/M_DAT.bin Enemy HP EXP Drops NOT ALL - Needs a proper merge with generateM_DAT.py

Modded Attack names need to be replaced inside of TEXT/EN/strings.txt - output strings should be generated together with the M_DAT file
