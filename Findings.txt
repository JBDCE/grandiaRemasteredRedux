when copying all files from battle in fight stats are set properly
for some reason the enemy stats are all saved collectively inside of m_dat.bin and player stats are mirrored over more than 100 files for each battle individually.. What the actual fuck

Item Descriptions hidden inside battle/bxxx.bbgh files - Take the last file from the final boss fight so it contains all items

Character Starting mp inside bin/mchar.dat - Can be straight copied from the redux disk (Needs checking if d1 or d2)

field/Windt.bin Modded Item Effects - Also a straight copy
field/Shop.bin Shop contents - Straigt copy
field.mdp files need to be copied else the shop items dont appear


battle/M_DAT.bin Enemy HP EXP Drops NOT ALL - Needs a proper merge with generateM_DAT.py

Modded Attack names need to be replaced inside of TEXT/EN/strings.txt - output strings should be generated together with the M_DAT file




ISSUES:

- Mad Snail Spin attack crashing the game
    Maybe id mismatch between original and remaster needs fix inside mdat.bin
